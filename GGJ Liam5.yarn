Narrator: The rumbles of your stomach awake you from your stupor.
Narrator: You take a deep breath and attmept to refocus your eyes on the half-finished masters thesis on the desk in front of you.
You: Ugghhh... I'm so hungry, I'm never gonna finish my thesis like this...
Narrator: You reach for your phone and open up Street Vendor, your favorite food delivery app.
Narrator: You feel yourself drool slightly as you browse your favorite restaurants.
Narrator: You eventually settle on Dragon In Your Throat and fill your cart with their famous dim sum.
Narrator: Now salivating vigorously, you place your order, only for a message to pop up on your phone.
Narrator: *Card Declined*
Narrator: You let out a pained, desperate sigh as you close the app and rise to your feet.
Narrator: You lumber over to your apartment's tiny kitchen and open up your fridge and pantry, only to be greeted by emptyness.
Narrator: As you survey your famine stricken shelves, you begin to consider your other options.
Narrator: You sigh once more as you open your phone and open up LoveQuest. Maybe you can get dinner out of some sap.
Narrator: You swipe through the endless list of people, searching for a suitable mark.
Narrator: Eventually you find one with the right mix of low standards, desperation, and relative normality: "Jeremy"
Narrator: You message him, asking him out to dinner. He responds quickly and agrees to meet you at a nearby French Bistro.
You: Hook, line, and sinker...
Narrator: You smirk as you get ready and leave. This shouldn't be too bad.

Jeremy: Hello, are you **playername**?
