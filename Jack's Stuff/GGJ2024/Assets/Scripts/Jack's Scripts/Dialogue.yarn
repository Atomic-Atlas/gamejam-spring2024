Wow!
My first ever Yarn script in Unity!
<<declare $points = 0>>
<<declare $optionSelected to false>>
-> Gosh! 
	<<set $points to 100>> 
	<<set $optionSelected to true>>
-> Incredible! 
	<<set $points to 1>>
	<<set $optionSelected to true>>
-> I'm amazed!
	<<set $points to 4>> 
	<<set $optionSelected to true>>

Anyway, time to get writing!
