Narrator: The rumbles of your stomach awake you from your stupor.
Narrator: You take a deep breath and attmept to refocus your eyes on the half-finished masters thesis on the desk in front of you.
You: Ugghhh... I'm so hungry, I'm never gonna finish my thesis like this...
Narrator: You reach for your phone and open up Street Vendor, your favorite food delivery app.
Narrator: You feel yourself drool slightly as you browse your favorite restaurants.
Narrator: You eventually settle on Dragon In Your Throat and fill your cart with their famous dim sum.
Narrator: Now salivating vigorously, you place your order, only for a message to pop up on your phone.
Narrator: *Card Declined*
Narrator: You let out a pained, desperate sigh as you close the app and rise to your feet.
Narrator: You lumber over to your apartment's tiny kitchen and open up your fridge and pantry, only to be greeted by emptyness.
Narrator: As you survey your famine stricken shelves, you begin to consider your other options.
Narrator: You sigh once more as you open your phone and open up LoveQuest. Maybe you can get dinner out of some sap.
Narrator: You swipe through the endless list of people, searching for a suitable mark.
Narrator: Eventually you find one with the right mix of low standards, desperation, and relative normality: "Jeremy"
Narrator: You message him, asking him out to dinner. He responds quickly and agrees to meet you at a nearby French Bistro.
You: Hook, line, and sinker...
Narrator: You smirk as you get ready and leave. This shouldn't be too bad.

Narrator: You arrive first. You grab a table and message Jeremy that you've arrived. 
Narrator: He repiles quickly, saying that he's almost there.
Narrator: Eventually you hear a brief commotion near the entrance to the restaurant. And you hear someone approach your table.
Jeremy: Hello, are you **playername**?
Jeremy: I'm Jeremy, I'm uhh...
Jeremy: I'm not really sure how to start this...
Jeremy: Oh that's right, my mom told me to ask people about themselves!
Jeremy: So uh, what do you do?

        Jeremy: I wonder how creme brulee was invented.

Jeremy: Of all the obscure films I've seen, which is my favorite?
Jeremy: That's easy! Cannibal Holocaust!
    -> Cannibal What?
        Jeremy: Cannibal Holocaust. Its an Italian film released in 1980. I admire it for the plot and filmmaking style.
            -> What's the plot about?
                Jeremy: Its about an anthropologist who leads a rescue team to find a crew of filmmakers who went missing while filming a documentary about cannibals in the Amazon.
                Jeremy: The anthropologist finds the film that the missing filmmakers took and it shows how they set up shots by killing and mutilating natives to make them seem more savage.
                Jeremy: Its famous for its extreme gore and brutality. It includes multiple actual animal deaths. In fact, there were rumors that the actors in the film were actually killed while filming.
                -> That's cool
                    Jeremy: Its pretty foul at times, but it uses the gore to tell an interesting story and make a cogent commentary about western society and who are the real savages.
                        -> That's interesting, I may have to check it out myself
                            Jeremy: I'd gladly show it to you, if you'd like, of course.

                                -> "Who are the real savages?" only works as a message if one side isn't literal cannibals
                                    Jeremy: Well its about the brutality of the so-called "civilized" compared to the so-called "uncivilized" and how civilization didn't make the filmmaker characters actually civilized.
                                        -> A few bad eggs don't debase western civilization as a whole
                                            Jeremy: Fair enough, I suppose.
                                -> Fliming yourself slaughtering real animals for a fake movie about the brutality of man forces you to cede any moral high ground
                                    Jeremy: Well if you think about it...
                                    Jeremy: Uh...
                                    Jeremy: Nah, you're right. I'm not gonna defend that.

                        -> Sure...
                            //jump to next course
            -> What's unique about the style?
                Jeremy: Its pretty much the original found footage film. It came out nearly 20 years before The Blair Witch Project popularized the style and it had a similar effect.
                Jeremy: The audience wasn't familiar with the found footage style, so many people thought it was real.
                Jeremy: It didn't help that the director had the actors take a low profile for a year after filming to feed the rumors that they were actually murdered in the movie.
    -> I've heard about that one, you actually watched it?
        Jeremy: Yes I have! I have the 2011 DVD version with the fewest cuts. Only 15 seconds was cut in that version.
            -> That's... Cool?
                Jeremy: I'd love to show it to you if you're interested.
